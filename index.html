<h2 class="section-title text-center"><i class="fa-solid fa-microscope icon-style"></i><br>Genomic Data Analysis & Precision Medicine</h2>
<div class="card-custom">
<p> 
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized genomics by enabling rapid sequencing of entire genomes. However, the raw sequencing output is highly complex and requires multiple computational steps before it becomes clinically meaningful.
A typical genomic analysis workflow includes:
1.	Generating raw sequence data
2.	Performing quality control
3.	Aligning sequences to a reference genome
4.	Identifying genetic variants
5.	Annotating functional significance
6.	Clinical interpretation
Through these bioinformatics pipelines, raw genetic data is transformed into actionable medical insights.
Precision medicine builds upon this foundation. Instead of applying uniform treatments to all patients, precision medicine considers individual genetic differences, environmental exposures, and lifestyle factors.
An important branch of precision medicine is pharmacogenomics. This field studies how genetic variations influence drug metabolism and therapeutic response. Certain gene variants can alter how patients respond to medications, affecting both efficacy and side effects.
By identifying these variations, healthcare providers can personalize drug selection and dosage, thereby improving treatment outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.

<div class="container fade-in">
<h2 class="section-title text-center"><i class="fa-solid fa-file-medical icon-style"></i><br>Electronic Health Records & Medical Coding</h2>
<div class="card-custom">
<p>
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital systems used to store and manage patient information. They have largely replaced traditional paper-based medical records, allowing healthcare professionals to access patient data quickly and securely across different departments and institutions.
An EHR typically includes:
•	Patient demographic details
•	Medical and clinical history
•	Laboratory and imaging results
•	Medication prescriptions
•	Treatment plans and follow-up notes
Because healthcare systems handle vast amounts of information, medical coding plays a crucial role. Coding systems assign standardized codes to diagnoses, procedures, and treatments. These standardized codes ensure consistency in documentation and improve communication between hospitals, insurance providers, and researchers.
There are several key advantages of EHR systems and medical coding:
•	Improved data organization and accessibility
•	Better interoperability between healthcare institutions
•	Efficient billing and insurance processing
•	Enhanced support for clinical research and analytics
Structured and coded data also enables large-scale population studies. Researchers can analyze disease trends, treatment outcomes, and healthcare utilization patterns using standardized datasets. This structured approach supports both clinical decision-making and public health planning.

<div class="card-custom">
<p>
Public health practice has increasingly become data-driven. With digital health records, laboratory reporting systems, and global connectivity, researchers now have access to large datasets that reflect population-level health trends.
Bioinformatics and data science contribute significantly to epidemiological modeling. Epidemiological models use mathematical and computational approaches to study how diseases spread within populations. These models consider factors such as demographics, environmental conditions, genetic susceptibility, and mobility patterns.
Key applications include:
1. Infectious Disease Surveillance
Real-time monitoring systems analyze hospital admissions and laboratory results to detect unusual patterns. This can provide early warnings for emerging infections.
2. Outbreak Prediction
Models such as the SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) framework simulate disease transmission dynamics. These models help policymakers evaluate the potential impact of interventions like lockdowns or vaccination campaigns.
3. Vaccination Impact Assessment
Data-driven approaches estimate herd immunity thresholds and assess vaccine effectiveness across populations.
4. Healthcare Resource Planning
Predictive analytics can forecast hospital bed occupancy, ICU demand, and medical supply requirements during health crises.
During pandemics and public health emergencies, data dashboards and forecasting tools enable governments to respond quickly. The integration of genomic sequencing with epidemiology, known as genomic epidemiology, further allows researchers to track viral mutations and transmission chains.
These technologies support informed decision-making at both national and global levels.
